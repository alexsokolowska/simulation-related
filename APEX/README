apex: X-ray luminosity calculator. Uses APEC output models.

"APEC output models in AtomDB are for optically-thin plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium. APEC outputs separate continuum and line emissivity files, making it easy to model continuum and line emission separately as well as together." http://www.atomdb.org

Calculation of the X-ray luminosity of your gasoline file.
Requires packages: astropy, pynbody, numpy, pickle, gc
Tested for atomdb_v3.0.2 (download here: http://www.atomdb.org/download.php).

Goal: compute total X-ray luminosity in the 0.5-2keV band within a virial radius of a halo, as a sum of the contribution from lines and a continuum.

How to run it:

1) Fill in the input_parameters.py according to the example.
2) run apex_gasoline.py (will produce intermediate files)
3) run apex.py (the X-ray luminosity will be printed to the command line).

That's all!
